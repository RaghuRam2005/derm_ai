## Features

- üî¨ **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Google Gemini AI to analyze skin images
- üë§ **User Authentication**: Optional login system to save analysis history
- üìä **Analysis History**: View previous analyses and results
- üéØ **Confidence Scoring**: Get confidence levels for each diagnosis
- üí° **Treatment Recommendations**: Receive potential treatment suggestions
- üîí **Secure**: Password hashing and user data protection

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key (free tier available)

### 2. Get Google Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the API key for later use

### 3. Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the project files
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Environment Setup

Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable:

**Windows:**
```cmd
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 5. Running the Application

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend:**
```bash
python main.py
```
This starts the FastAPI backend on `http://localhost:8000`

**Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This starts the Streamlit frontend on `http://localhost:8501`

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Medical Disclaimer**: This application is for educational and informational purposes only. Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for proper medical diagnosis and treatment.

### Privacy and Security
- Passwords are hashed using SHA-256
- Images are not permanently stored
- Analysis history is linked to user accounts

### Limitations
- Requires internet connection for AI analysis
- Analysis quality depends on image quality
- Not a substitute for professional medical advice

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend Connection Error**
   - Ensure backend is running on port 8000
   - Check if GEMINI_API_KEY is set correctly

2. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify your Gemini API key is valid
   - Check if you have API quota remaining

3. **Image Upload Issues**
   - Ensure image is in supported format (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
   - Check image file size (should be reasonable)

4. **Database Issues**
   - Delete `skin_app.db` to reset the database
   - Ensure write permissions in the app directory

## Customization

### Adding New Features
- Modify `app.py` for frontend changes
- Update `main.py` for backend functionality
- Add new dependencies to `requirements.txt`

### Styling
- Streamlit supports custom CSS
- Modify the `st.set_page_config()` for page settings

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

Backend with auto-reload:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Frontend with auto-reload:
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.runOnSave true
```

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:
- Using environment variables for sensitive data
- Setting up proper database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Using HTTPS for security
- Implementing rate limiting
- Adding logging and monitoring
